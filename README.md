# 🌌 FinVerse – Smart Finance Ecosystem

FinVerse is an AI-powered personal finance ecosystem built for the **CheetahAI Hackathon at MSRIT**.  
It combines two products:

## 💸 FinMate – Smart Payment & Budget Manager
FinMate helps users manage their money in a simple, structured, and intelligent way:

- Main Balance + Custom **Pockets** (Food, Travel, Rent, etc.)
- Make payments using **Main Balance or Pocket**
- One-click transfers (simulated with points, not real money)
- Group bill splitting with pocket selection
- Save QR/Payment IDs and link them to specific pockets
- Gamified experience:
  - Earn points for saving
  - Unlock badges (Beginner → Saver Star → Finance King)
- Visual analytics with charts (pie, bar, monthly comparison)
- Daily finance quotes + dark mode

All money shown (₹) is **simulated using points**.  
**No real transactions or UPI APIs are used.**
